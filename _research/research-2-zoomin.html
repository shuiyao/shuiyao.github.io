title: "Baryonic History of Local Structures"
excerpt: "We reconstruct the dynamic histories of the local Universe using a novel technique from the observed current-day density field, and re-run hydrodynamic simulations to explore the evolution of local structures, such as the SDSS Greatwall and the Coma cluster. <br/><br/><img src='/images/zoomin_coma.png' style='width:800px;height:450px;'>"

Using galaxy survey data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01763" target="_blank">Wang et al. (2016)</a> reconstructed at unprecedented accuracy the linear density field in the early Universe that would evolve into the nearby large scale structures observed today. Focusing on specific regions in the local Universe, such as the SDSS Greatwall region and the Coma cluster, we are running high resolution zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations from the reconstructed initial conditions, including all baryonic processes already implemented. For the first time in this field, we will be able to study how these structures formed and evolved through cosmic time, and make unambiguous predictions for a variety of observations both existing and planned for the future.
