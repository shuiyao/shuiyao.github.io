I implemented several recent numerical improvements of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique, including a new formalism of hydrodynamic equations, and more accurate algorithms for artificial viscosity, artificial conduction and time-step criteria into the GADGET-3 code along with a refined cooling algorithm. We examined the robustness of a wide range of our previous predictions to hydrodynamic algorithms and cooling physics using a set of test cosmological simulations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12946" target="_blank">Huang et al., 2018</a>)
</p>

The picture demonstrates the code's capability of resolving the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability after being upgraded with a new formalism of solving the equations of motion.
