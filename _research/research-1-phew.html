Galactic winds are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution. The underlying physics of the galactic winds, as well as their influence on the galaxies and the intergalactic/circumgalactic gas have been a primary challenge that requires close cooperative efforts from observations, numerical simulations and analytic studies. With my advisor and our collaborators, we develop and run hydrodynamic simulations on high performance computing clusters to study galaxy formation and evolution. My primary interests consist of a pioneering work of modelling the evolution of galactic winds in our simulations using a physical sub-grid model. This critical physical process occurs on small scales that are numerically unresolved by simulations of today and will remain unresolved in the near future. Therefore, we develop an analytic model that predicts the winds evolution in various environments, based on parsec-resolution cloud-crushing simulations and implement this model into our simulations. Using this new set of simulations, we combine the numerical results with multi-wavelength observational data from the world's most advanced telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope to offer new insights into understanding galaxy formation and evolution.
