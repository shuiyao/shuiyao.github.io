title: "Physically Evolved Wind (PhEW)"
excerpt: "We developed an analytic model for a cold, dense cloud moving through a warm, diffuse ambient, based on results from high-resolution single cloud hydrodynamic simulations (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13585' target='_blank'>Huang et al. 2020b</a>). This model explores a range of physical conditions that are relevant to the outflow-CGM interactions and include a detailed treatment of a variety of microphysical processes that are usually ignored or insufficiently modeled in current cosmological simulations or analytic studies. We are also numerically implementing it into cosmological simulations to explicitly model how cold outflows propagate through the diffuse CGM and will specifically apply it to interpreting current and future observations. <br/><br/><img src='/images/phew_cartoon.png' style='width:800px;height:350px;'>"

Cosmological hydrodynamic simulation has been a primary tool to understand galaxy formation and the properties of the CGM. However, current simulations lack the resolution to self-consistently generate galactic winds and rely on sub-grid prescriptions to model them. An often adopted method in particle-based simulations is to stochastically eject gas particles from the simulated galaxies to model galactic winds. In this method, the outflowing flux of mass and momentum is determined from the properties of the host galaxy, then particles are selected and given a range of initial velocities so that they could escape the galaxy as winds.

However, this method lacks a proper description for the interactions between the winds and the CGM. After the wind particles are ejected, their future evolution in the CGM is governed only by the hydrodynamics, which suffers from numerical artifacts while handling the motion between the poorly represented cold outflowing particles and the warm ambient medium. Microphysics such as hydrodynamic instabilities, thermal instability, thermal conduction that occur at the interface between multi-phase gas are also critical to the evolution of the outflowing gas, but are far from being resolved by cosmological simulations of today and the near future. Furthermore, the lack of a physical model describing the nature of cold outflows and their interactions with the CGM prevents a thorough comparison between simulations and observations.

A focus of my current research is to build a more physically accurate model, Physically Evolved Winds (PhEW), that follows the evolution of winds as they propagate through the surrounding medium after being ejected from their host galaxy. We assume the winds as composed of many small, cold cloudlets and evolve them analytically by calculating the interactions between these cloudlets and the ambient medium they are moving through, until they are mixed with the surroundings. The analytic model captures the key physics that govern the cloud evolution, including ram pressure, hydrodynamic instabilities, flux limited thermal conduction, evaporation and condensation, and makes predictions for how fast the cloudlets exchange mass, momentum, energy and metallicity with the ambient (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13585" target="_blank">Huang et al. 2020b</a>).

Modeling wind-CGM interactions in cosmological simulations with PhEW will have a variety of consequences such as the distances that the winds can propagate, the amount of mass and metals that mix into the CGM, the amount of winds that re-accrete and fuel future star formation, the thermodynamic and ionization states of the warm-hot gas. All of these have strong effects on the properties of the galaxy and the CGM. Furthermore, It will help interpret quasar absorption line measurements to a greater extent, allowing them to reach their full potential for constraining galaxy formation processes. The PhEW model, by construction, is resolution independent and is free of the many numerical artifacts present in the simulation of multi-phase gas. The behavior of the PhEW is therefore controlled by a few key parameters such as the mass of each cloudlet. This would allow us to empirically explore the connections between the nature of the winds and their observational signatures in the CGM.
