My current research focuses on using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to study galaxy formation and evolution. My Ph.D. thesis focuses on characterizing the impact of galactic outflows (winds) on galaxy evolution and on the observed properties of gas that lies beyond the optical part of galaxies, which composes the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intergalactic medium (IGM). See the [Research](https://shuiyao.github.io/research) page for a list of current and past projects.
